In project Evolutionary Steering Behaviors:

The first generation has 500 elements..

The Green is food, the Red is poison..

Each move will consume a certain amount of energy, eating food will increase energy, eating poison will reduce energy. If the energy is 0, the element will die.

Cloning helps maintain healthy individuals. Over many generations, this evolution will be more apparent.
